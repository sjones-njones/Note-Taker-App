## Description

This project is a note taker app that allows the user to save their notes to the browser. This is first time I have used express and the first time that I have written an app that connects front and back end. I struggled the most understanding how to use so many files in conjunction.       

## Installation 

This app requires Inquirer and Express to be installed to run properly.
